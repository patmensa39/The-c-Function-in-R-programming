## R Markdown

The c function is used to combined data. For example. 1,2,3,4,5 can be combined into a vector by doing the folowing

```{r}
vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
vector
```

## The c function is not limited to only numeric data. Lets combine these charaters to string vectors



```{r }
vector2 <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
vector2
```

### Numeric and character string can be combined together

```{r}
vector3 <-c(1, "a", 16, "c")
vector3
```
